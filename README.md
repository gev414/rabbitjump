# rabbitjump
random challenge i did a while ago and found the code.

A farmer has a square garden full of carrots, but a rabbit comes and eats hit produce. 
The rabbit only jumps in between carrots in a way that he would be surrounded. (jumps between 4 carrots only)
Write a program that calculates how many times would the rabbit leap in such a garden.
